## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this challenge I learned to create a design adapted to screens of different devices.

During practice I made use of the media queries option.

Media queries are useful when you want to modify your site or app depending on a device's general type (such as print vs. screen) or specific characteristics and parameters (such as screen resolution or browser viewport width).

```css
@media screen, print { ... }
```

### Continued development

After this challenge, I think I have to practice with media queries.

### Useful resources

- [Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - This helped me show the adaptive design.
